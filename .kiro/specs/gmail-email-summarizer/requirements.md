# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a command-line Python tool that connects to a Gmail account, identifies important and unread emails, extracts their content, and generates daily summaries stored locally. The tool focuses on automation and simplicity, requiring no user interface beyond command-line execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a busy professional, I want to connect to my Gmail account programmatically, so that I can access my emails without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is executed THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Gmail using OAuth2
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and exit gracefully
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the Gmail API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to identify important and unread emails, so that I only get summaries of relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for emails THEN the system SHALL filter for messages that are both unread AND marked as important
2. WHEN no important unread emails exist THEN the system SHALL log this status and create an empty summary file
3. WHEN important unread emails are found THEN the system SHALL retrieve their full content including subject, sender, and body

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want email content to be extracted and summarized, so that I can quickly understand the key points without reading full emails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing each email THEN the system SHALL extract the subject, sender, date, and body content
2. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL handle both plain text and HTML email formats
3. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL generate a concise summary of each email's key points
4. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL preserve important details like dates, names, and action items

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want summaries stored locally in daily YAML files, so that I can review them later in a structured format and track email patterns over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN summaries are generated THEN the system SHALL create a YAML file named with the current date (YYYY-MM-DD.yaml format)
2. WHEN a daily summary file already exists THEN the system SHALL append new summaries to the existing YAML structure
3. WHEN storing summaries THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, email count, and individual email summaries in valid YAML format
4. WHEN no emails are processed THEN the system SHALL still create a YAML file indicating no important emails were found

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple command-line interface, so that I can easily run the tool manually or schedule it automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is executed THEN the system SHALL run from a single command-line entry point
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of actions taken (emails processed, file created)
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and exit with appropriate status codes
4. WHEN the tool runs successfully THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 0

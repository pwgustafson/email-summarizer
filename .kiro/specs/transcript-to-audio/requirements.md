# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will extend the Gmail Email Summarizer to convert generated transcripts into audio files using OpenAI's text-to-speech (TTS) API. Users will be able to listen to their email summaries as audio files, making the content more accessible and convenient for consumption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert my daily transcript files to audio format, so that I can listen to my email summaries instead of reading them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transcript file exists THEN the system SHALL provide an option to convert it to audio
2. WHEN converting to audio THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI's text-to-speech API
3. WHEN audio conversion is successful THEN the system SHALL save the audio file as an MP3 in an 'audio_summaries' directory
4. WHEN audio conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and continue operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to integrate audio generation into my existing CLI workflow, so that I can generate audio files easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL support a command-line option to convert existing transcripts to audio
2. WHEN generating audio files THEN the system SHALL name them using the same date format as transcript files (YYYY-MM-DD.mp3)
3. WHEN the audio directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
4. WHEN an audio file already exists THEN the system SHALL overwrite it with the new version
